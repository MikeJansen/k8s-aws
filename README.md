# k8s-aws

This is another skills practice project for me.  Deploy Kubernetes on AWS with Ansible, Terraform,
and kubeadm powered by GitHub Actions.

Currently there's only a `main` branch where I'm committing in ADHD, get it working mode.  Normally 
this would all be done in a branch and then organized and squashed before merging into `main`.  But 
it's more the end result I'm going for currently. 

I haven't organized Issues, but feel free to add questions or legit issues there.

This is not intended to be a pattern for a production deployment.  It's simply a playground for me 
to practice multiple tools and skills.
